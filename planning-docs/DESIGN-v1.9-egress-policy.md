# DESIGN — Authorized Egress + Policy & Audit Surface: `git.push`, `http.request` WRITE, the policy↔I2 boundary

**Milestone:** v1.9 — Authorized Egress + Policy & Audit Surface
**Phase:** 41 (Design Gate) — blocks all `crates/{executor,brokerd,sandbox,runtime-core}`
and `cli/` TCB code for this milestone
**Status:** Draft → pending a fresh, **non-self, orchestrator-owned** adversarial
code-trace (DESIGN-18) to be recorded in `planning-docs/DESIGN-GATE-RECORD-v1.9.md`.
This doc is authored by a `gsd-executor`; the executor does **not** run or self-perform
that trace (gsd-executors have no Agent tool — §9).
**Author date:** 2026-07-18
**Grounding:** `.planning/research/GIT-PUSH-EGRESS.md` (the AUTHORITATIVE `git.push`
mechanism input — pins candidate (b)), `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (DESIGN-17/18,
GIT-02/03, HTTP-W-01, POLICY-01/02/03, HYG-01, LIVE-05/06), and the v1.8 doc
`planning-docs/DESIGN-git-github-http-sinks.md` (whose §2 / §2.5 / §2.7 / §9 carry
forward here **by reference**). Every `file:line` below traces to a direct code read
this session; re-verify if Phases 42-46 begin many commits later, per this project's own
convention.
**Requirements:** DESIGN-17 (this doc) → enables POLICY-01/02/03 (Phase 42),
HTTP-W-01 (Phase 43), GIT-02/03 + HYG-01 (Phase 44), SDK-01 + U1 (Phase 45),
LIVE-05/06 (Phase 46). DESIGN-18 is the gate that clears it (§9).

## §0. Purpose & Scope

**What this doc pins (DESIGN-17).** The TCB mechanism + fail-closed default for the three
v1.9 external surfaces, before any TCB code exists:

1. **`git.push`** (§1) — a **broker-performed git smart-HTTP transfer** (research
   candidate (b)): the broker plays the HTTP mover (reqwest resolve-and-pin, TLS
   terminates broker-side), the push child stays **fully net-denied** and does only
   local pack generation. The destination pin lives in the broker application layer that
   SEES the destination IP:port (`reqwest .resolve(host, pinned_ip)`), **never seccomp**.
   Closes the research's three adversarial attack points (credential leak; redirect/
   DNS-rebind pin-bypass; payload-vs-destination confirm TOCTOU). Effect-class
   `CommitIrreversible`.
2. **`http.request` WRITE (POST/PUT)** (§2) — a **distinct sink id** (`http.request.write`)
   classified **`EffectClass::CommitIrreversible`** (§2.0, so a draft/untrusted-seeded
   session cannot Allow a POST — it does NOT inherit the GET id's `Observe` class), a
   **distinct** write host-allowlist (separate from the shipped GET allowlist),
   taint-governed content-sensitive body under I2, a **schema-validated `method` enum**,
   routing-sensitive `url`, broker-env-only credential custody with response scrub, and
   **differential** acceptance.
3. **The policy↔I2 boundary** (§5), incl. **POLICY-03 binding** — policy is a **pre-I2
   narrowing gate** (which sinks/args are callable), refusing with a distinct
   machine-checkable policy-deny outcome; it can NEVER disable/override I2; I2 stays
   **HARDCODED** in the Rust TCB executor, unconditional on every policy-permitted call;
   the policy is bound by the broker at session creation from a trusted source outside the
   confined worker's reach (F1 containment **EXTRACTED into one shared, unit-tested helper**
   called by BOTH MAC-key custody and policy binding — the inline `cli/caprun/src/key.rs`
   check is `pub(crate)` and unreachable from the broker binder, so it is factored out, not
   reused verbatim; §5.3), immutable, hash recorded as an audit-DAG event.

Plus: the **crypto-provider / supply-chain** decision (§3 — ring-only, ZERO new crates),
the **fail-closed defaults table** (§4), a **§-per-pitfall threat model** (§6),
**invariant preservation** (§7), the **new-symbol summary** (§8), the
**orchestrator-owned adversarial-trace gate** (§9), and the **acceptance predicate** (§10).

**Carried forward from v1.8 BY REFERENCE (not restated wholesale).** The following v1.8
sections are load-bearing for v1.9 and are extended, not re-derived, here:

- **v1.8 §2** (`git.push` = Pattern-B local dispatch, child net-denied, broker-mediated
  egress; FORK-1 re-decided). v1.9 §1 realizes its deferred Open-Item-1 mechanism.
- **v1.8 §2.5** (captured-output credential scrub / opaque-payload discipline). v1.9 §1.4
  and §2 inherit it verbatim.
- **v1.8 §2.7** (pushed-payload visibility at confirm — commit range + tainted-file
  provenance summary). v1.9 §1.6 inherits it and adds the anti-TOCTOU freeze.
- **v1.8 §9** (P33/P34 confirm-release audit-gap discipline: terminal audit event before
  terminal state, `prepare_*` precheck, entry-guard allow-list extension). v1.9 §1.7
  applies it to `git.push` (and, if confirm-releasable, http-write).

**Two shipped dispatch patterns, unchanged; no new pattern, no raw effect-request path.**

- **Pattern A — in-broker / broker-helper network egress.** The shipped
  `crates/brokerd/src/sinks/http_request.rs` resolve-and-pin GET egress
  (`invoke_http_get`, `http_request.rs:414`) + the already-present authenticated POST
  (`invoke_pinned_post`, `http_request.rs:506`) are the exemplars. `git.push`'s network
  leg (§1) and `http.request` WRITE (§2) both live here — broker-resident, never
  confined-worker-resident.
- **Pattern B — broker-spawned confined child.** `crates/brokerd/src/sinks/process_exec.rs`
  `run_launcher` (`process_exec.rs:402`) with `env_clear()` (`process_exec.rs:422`) +
  minimal `SAFE_EXEC_PATH` (`process_exec.rs:385`). `git.push`'s **local pack-generation
  child** rides this unchanged from `git.commit`; its seccomp net-deny is identical to
  `git.commit`'s (§1.2).

**Locked terminology (unchanged):** `Intent`, `Session`, `Planner`, `Worker`, `Broker`,
`Adapter`, `Effect`, `Artifact`, `Event`. `ExecutionContext` stays internal-only. Nothing
here introduces new public-API vocabulary.

**No TCB code this phase.** This doc lives entirely under `planning-docs/`. The git diff
for Plan 41-01 touches only `planning-docs/DESIGN-v1.9-egress-policy.md`.
`scripts/check-invariants.sh` stays green (its prose under `planning-docs/` trips no Gate
that scans `crates/` or `cli/`).

## §1. `git.push` egress — broker-performed smart-HTTP transfer, child fully net-denied (GIT-02/03)

This realizes v1.8 §2 Open-Item-1 with the mechanism the research pins as **FEASIBLE**
(`.planning/research/GIT-PUSH-EGRESS.md`, "PIN: Candidate (b)"). A third deferral is **not**
warranted — but the safety-valve (§1.9) remains, disclosed and sign-off-gated, if the
adversarial trace proves the mechanism unsound.

### 1.1 The pinned mechanism — candidate (b), the git-native split

`git.push`'s network leg is performed by the **broker**, over the SAME already-shipped
Pattern-A egress path the design gate already blessed as sound (application-mediated, not
kernel-syscall-filtered): `reqwest =0.13.4` + `rustls 0.23` (ring) + `webpki-roots` +
SSRF resolve-and-pin (`http_request.rs`). Git's smart-HTTP push is a well-specified
**two-request** exchange the broker drives directly (`gitprotocol-http`):

1. `GET $URL/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack` → pkt-line ref advertisement + `report-status`.
2. `POST $URL/git-receive-pack` (`Content-Type: application/x-git-receive-pack-request`),
   body = pkt-line command-list (`<old> <new> <ref>`) + `"PACK" <binary>`.

**DECISION — the git-native split (`[rev: MINOR-5]` realization preference).** The broker
plays the **HTTP-mover role** (reqwest, TLS broker-side, `.resolve(host, pinned_ip)` = the
pin); TLS and the entire network leg live **broker-side**, and the child never opens an
`AF_INET`/`AF_INET6` socket. The research rates the `git send-pack --stateless-rpc`
realization only **MEDIUM confidence**, so the **PRIMARY realization is: the broker generates
the `receive-pack` request body DIRECTLY** from the workspace `.git` (the broker has fs
access) — pkt-line command-list + `PACK` — which **avoids the `send-pack` URL-arg /
subprocess-invocation surface entirely**. The **documented ALTERNATIVE** is driving **`git
send-pack --stateless-rpc` as the net-denied child** for pure-local delta + pack computation
(no socket), reading request bodies on stdin / writing stdout while the broker owns the
socket. **Either way the child is net-denied**; Phase 44 picks the realization under the §1.9
constraint, **preferring direct body generation** to shrink the invocation surface — with the
§1.8 seccomp fail-closed backstop and the §1.9 safety-valve applying to **both** realizations.

The child's **local dispatch is `git.commit`'s Pattern-B path unchanged** (v1.8 §1.1 /
§2): broker spawns the `caprun-exec-launcher`, which self-confines then `execve`s `git`;
the confined worker never `execve`s git (its own filter denies `execve` unconditionally,
`seccomp.rs:65`). Effect-class = pinned **`CommitIrreversible`** (matching the locked
`IrreversibleEffect::GitPush` ontology, v1.8 §2.1).

### 1.2 Child stays FULLY net-denied — the pin is application-layer, NEVER seccomp

**DECISION (carries v1.8 §2.1/§2.3 FORK-1, the BLOCKER-1 correction — LOCKED).** The
`git.push` child's seccomp filter is the exec-child filter **verbatim** — `exec_child_filter`
(`sandbox/src/seccomp.rs:147`) denies `socket(AF_INET)` and `socket(AF_INET6)` with `EPERM`
(`seccomp.rs:163-188`), identical to `git.commit`. There is **NO seccomp relaxation**, because
seccomp-bpf provably cannot pin a destination: it gates syscall numbers + scalar registers
only, and `connect()`'s destination is a `struct sockaddr *` behind a pointer it cannot
dereference; `socket()` exposes only the address *family*. The only relaxation seccomp could
make is all-or-nothing "stop denying `AF_INET`," which grants **arbitrary egress** to a
credential-bearing child — the exact exfiltration primitive the taint model exists to defeat.
Landlock cannot help either (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_TCP` needs ABI V4 / kernel 6.7 above
the 5.13 floor, and filters by port only). This is a caprun anti-requirement
(`.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` Out of Scope: "Seccomp-based git.push destination pinning",
"Net-allowed git.push child").

**The destination pin lives in the broker application layer that SEES the IP:port.** It is
`reqwest.Client::builder().resolve(host, pinned)` (`http_request.rs:337`) inside
`build_pinned_client` (`http_request.rs:333`), fed the exact SSRF-vetted IP from
`vet_resolved` (`http_request.rs:313`) via `resolve_and_pin` (`http_request.rs:431`). The
same locus already enforces the GET/POST pin live-proven on Linux (Phase 40). **The pin is
NEVER claimed of seccomp.** seccomp's role for `git.push` is purely the fail-closed backstop
(§1.8), not the pin.

### 1.3 Remote/refspec from TRUSTED intent; `--force`/deletion hard-denied

**DECISION.** The push **remote URL + refspec are captured from the TRUSTED intent at
session creation** and passed explicitly to the transfer leg — **NEVER** resolved from the
untrusted repo's `.git/config` (which a prompt-injected worker could rewrite). This mirrors
`email_smtp.rs`'s D-04 endpoint sourcing (v1.8 §2.2): routing identity comes from trusted
config, never from block-time-writable state. `remote` + `refspec` are **I2-gated sink
args** (tainted → Block, §4).

`--force` / `--force-with-lease`, `:refspec` ref-deletion, and `+`-prefixed force-refspec
are **hard-denied by construction** at arg validation — unreachable **even via a human
confirm** (a human confirms a *specific* push, not a license to rewrite history). This
carries v1.8 §2.4 verbatim onto the broker-driven path: the broker MUST refuse to build a
receive-pack command-list containing a delete (`<new>` = zero-id) or a force update it was
not constructed to permit.

### 1.4 Attack point (i) — credential leak (carries v1.8 §2.5)

The push token now transits the **broker's own HTTP client** (it plays the mover), so the
broker holds the credential AND sees the full HTTP exchange — the highest-value leak surface.
**DECISION (carries v1.8 §2.5 verbatim):**

- The credential lives in **broker-local env ONLY** — never a `ValueNode`, plan-node arg,
  audit-DAG literal, the confined worker, or the planner sidecar. It is supplied to the
  transfer as the `Authorization` header value on the **single frozen-IP POST request**
  (§1.5) — the `bearer`/basic header slot used by `invoke_pinned_post`
  (`http_request.rs:506-517`), but set on the POST issued through the ONE `build_pinned_client`
  client of §1.5 (**NOT** through `invoke_pinned_post`'s re-resolving wrapper — `[rev:
  MINOR-3]`) — set on the request, never persisted.
- If the push instead drives `git` for the network leg in any variant, the credential is the
  ONE explicitly-injected non-`SAFE_EXEC_PATH` env var (`extra_env`, `process_exec.rs:394`)
  scoped to that child alone, riding `run_launcher`'s `env_clear()` discipline
  (`process_exec.rs:422`) proven by `run_launcher_env_clear_prevents_broker_secret_leak`
  (`process_exec.rs:850`).
- **Captured child/transport output follows the opaque/scrub discipline, NOT
  `process.exec`'s mint-the-output default.** A network exchange routinely echoes
  endpoint/credential-adjacent material a local commit never does (proxy-auth `407`,
  redirect/URL echoes on `401`). So the push's captured stdout/stderr and any HTTP response
  body is **either not minted at all** (only a broker-side opaque `git_push_succeeded`/
  `_failed` event carrying `effect_id`) **or scrubbed of any `https://…@…` userinfo /
  `Authorization:` / token / proxy-auth substring before minting**. A regression test MUST
  assert **no credential or remote-URL substring survives into the value store, the audit
  chain, OR broker LOG output** on the git-push HTTP legs (LIVE-06 leg 5, the post-push
  credential-absence assertion). This closes research attack-point (i)'s **broker-log** leak
  vector (`[rev: MINOR-4]`): `do_pinned_post`'s error path (`http_request.rs:542`) can embed
  URL/redirect material (proxy-auth `407`, URL echoes on `401`) into a broker log line, so on
  those legs the broker MUST NOT log the response body / remote URL — or, equivalently, the
  credential-absence assertion MUST cover the broker's log sink, not only the value store +
  audit chain (consistent with the §4 `git.push credential custody` row, which already lists
  `broker-log` as a violation surface).

### 1.5 Attack point (ii) — destination-pin bypass via redirect / DNS-rebind

The two-request exchange opens a rebind/redirect window the single-request GET does not.
**DECISION:**

- **One frozen resolved IP across BOTH requests.** The IP vetted and pinned for the
  `info/refs` GET is **reused (frozen)** for the `git-receive-pack` POST — there is **no
  re-resolve between requests**. `resolve_and_pin` (`http_request.rs:431`) already returns a
  client bound to the exact vetted IP set (its doc: "The resolved IPs are the EXACT set
  vetted and pinned (no re-resolve later — DNS-rebind TOCTOU close)"). Phase 44 MUST build
  the POST from the SAME pinned `SocketAddr` the GET used — so a DNS answer that flips between
  requests cannot move the POST.
- **`invoke_pinned_post` CANNOT be reused as-is for the two-request git flow (`[rev:
  MINOR-3]`, reconciles §1.4).** The shipped `invoke_pinned_post` (`http_request.rs:506`)
  calls `resolve_and_pin` **internally** (`http_request.rs:531`), which performs a **fresh DNS
  resolve** (`http_request.rs:435-444`). Driving the `git-receive-pack` POST through
  `invoke_pinned_post` would therefore **re-resolve between the GET and the POST** — reopening
  the exact DNS-rebind window this section exists to close (the GET's vetted IP and the POST's
  could differ). So Phase 44 MUST instead build a **single `reqwest::Client` ONCE** — from
  **one** vetted `SocketAddr` via `build_pinned_client` (`http_request.rs:333`) — and issue
  **BOTH** the `info/refs` GET and the receive-pack POST through that one frozen-IP client.
  The reusable primitive is **`build_pinned_client`** (it takes an already-vetted addr), NOT
  `invoke_pinned_post` (which re-resolves). The §1.4 credential pointer is reconciled to this:
  the `Authorization` header is set on the POST issued by that one client, not by
  `invoke_pinned_post`.
- **POST 3xx redirects refused.** `build_pinned_client` sets
  `.redirect(reqwest::redirect::Policy::none())` (`http_request.rs:335`) — a followed
  redirect = arbitrary egress = the exfil primitive. This governs the **POST**, not just the
  GET: a `git-receive-pack` 3xx (renamed repo / org redirect) MUST be refused, never
  followed. Because Phase 44 builds BOTH requests from the SAME `build_pinned_client` client
  (redirect-none already set at `http_request.rs:335`), redirect-none is in force for the POST
  **without** routing through the re-resolving `invoke_pinned_post` (`http_request.rs:525-542`);
  Phase 44 MUST NOT introduce a redirect-following client for the git leg.

### 1.6 Attack point (iii) — payload-vs-destination confirm TOCTOU (carries v1.8 §2.7)

I2 mediates values routed into sink args; `git.push`'s args are `remote` + `refspec` only,
so absent a mechanism the human would authorize a destination without seeing what leaves the
boundary. **DECISION (carries v1.8 §2.7 + adds an anti-TOCTOU freeze):**

- At the `git.push` confirm prompt the human is shown (a) the pushed commit range / branch,
  and (b) a **provenance summary of the pushed diff flagging any file whose content derives
  from untrusted taint** (via the value-store provenance the executor already tracks). The
  **payload**, not just `remote`/`refspec`, is what the human authorizes.
- **Anti-TOCTOU freeze:** the pack is **generated/frozen from the confirmed commit range
  at-or-after confirm** — there is no window in which a compromised worker rewrites the tree
  between confirm and pack generation. The provenance summary shown at confirm MUST describe
  the **same bytes** that get POSTed. Because the broker (not the worker) drives pack
  generation from the confirmed commit range at-or-after confirm, the worker cannot
  substitute tree content post-confirm.
- Accepted residual (carries v1.8 §11): this surfaces provenance for human judgment; it does
  not by itself Block untainted-but-sensitive committed content — that remains the human's
  call at confirm, consistent with the confirmation model.

### 1.7 Confirm-release audit-gap discipline (carries v1.8 §9 — P33/P34)

`git.push` is `CommitIrreversible` + confirm-releasable. **DECISION (carries v1.8 §9
verbatim):** the confirm-release path writes the **TERMINAL AUDIT EVENT before the terminal
state** — never a terminal state (`Confirmed` / `confirm_granted`) before the terminal event
that justifies it. Phase 44 MUST add a `prepare_git_push` precheck run at `confirm()`'s
Step 4.8-class point **before** Step 5 appends `confirm_granted` (`confirmation.rs:928-941`)
and Step 6 burns the one-shot — folding every fallible pre-transfer leg through the single
terminal-event branch, exactly as `prepare_process_exec` (`confirmation.rs:864`,
`process_exec.rs:362`) and the `github.pr` Step 4.8b precheck (`confirmation.rs:872-903`)
already do. The `confirm()` Step 4.75 entry-guard allow-list of confirm-releasable sinks
(`confirmation.rs:825-846`) MUST be extended to admit `git.push` — a confirm-releasable sink
absent from that allow-list is denied at the guard (fail-closed), so the extension is
required, not optional. A regression test MUST assert **no dangling `confirm_granted` without
a terminal event** on any pre-transfer failure leg. This is the recurring MAJOR audit-gap
class a passing verifier + green gates missed twice (v1.7 P33 file.write, P34 process.exec)
and only the fresh adversarial trace caught.

### 1.8 `send-pack` self-egress — the seccomp fail-closed backstop

If `git send-pack --stateless-rpc` (or any git subprocess in the child) ever attempts its own
`connect()`/DNS, the child's seccomp `socket(AF_INET/AF_INET6) → EPERM`
(`seccomp.rs:163-188`) is the **fail-closed backstop** — the transport MUST delegate all
network to the broker mover (it does; `--stateless-rpc` reads request bodies on stdin and
writes to stdout, leaving the socket to the HTTP mover). This is a backstop, not the pin: the
pin is §1.2's application-layer resolve; the backstop guarantees a mover-bypass attempt fails
closed rather than reaching an arbitrary host.

### 1.9 Safety-valve — disclosed, sign-off-gated deferral (never a silent drop)

**DECISION (carries v1.8 §2.1 HARD CONSTRAINT + GIT-02/LIVE-05 safety-valve).** If the
orchestrator-owned adversarial code-trace (§9) proves that no fully-unprivileged
destination-pinning mechanism is sound under review — i.e. the broker-performed transfer
does not actually keep the child net-denied while pinning the destination in a locus that
sees it — then `git.push` (GIT-02/GIT-03) **DEFERS** rather than shipping with any
arbitrary-egress fallback. The deferral is:

- **Disclosed** — recorded as a milestone gap in `DESIGN-GATE-RECORD-v1.9.md`, not silently
  dropped;
- **Sign-off-gated** — requires explicit user sign-off (never an orchestrator-autonomous
  drop, LIVE-05 `[rev: M6/n1]`);
- **Scoped** — the `git.push` leg auto-descopes from LIVE-05/06; the other three tracks
  (POLICY, http-write, SDK/viewer) proceed untouched (that is why the roadmap splits
  GIT-02/03 from HTTP-W-01 by blast radius).

Shipping arbitrary child egress is **never** an option — that is the exact primitive the
BLOCKER-1 correction exists to prevent.

---

## §2. `http.request` WRITE (POST/PUT) egress — distinct allowlist, taint-governed body (HTTP-W-01)

v1.8 shipped `http.request` GET (Pattern A) and, for `github.pr`, an authenticated
`invoke_pinned_post` (`http_request.rs:506`). v1.9 generalizes WRITE into a first-class,
I2-governed sink. **DECISIONS:**

### 2.0 A DISTINCT WRITE sink id (`http.request.write`), classed `CommitIrreversible` — the I0-gate pin (`[rev: MAJOR-1]`, BLOCKER-class)

**DECISION (BLOCKER-level — closes an I0-gate escape).** `http.request` WRITE is a
**DISTINCT sink id — `http.request.write`** — **NOT** an extension of the shipped GET id
`http.request`. This is load-bearing for I0. `sink_effect_class`
(`crates/executor/src/sink_sensitivity.rs:40-83`) keys on **sink-id ONLY**, and the shipped
`"http.request" => EffectClass::Observe` row (`sink_sensitivity.rs:64`) classes the GET id
**`Observe`**. The I0/Draft lifecycle deny (`crates/executor/src/lib.rs:206-239`) fires
**only** when `sink_effect_class == CommitIrreversible` (`lib.rs:217`); an `Observe`-classed
sink **falls through → Allowed even in a draft / untrusted-seeded session**. So *extending*
the existing `http.request` id to also carry POST/PUT keeps it `Observe` and lets a **WRITE
POST escape the I0 gate** — a prompt-injected, draft-only session could exfiltrate through a
POST body with no confirm. A distinct id is the fix:

- **`http.request.write` is classified `EffectClass::CommitIrreversible`** — **explicitly**
  (a dedicated `"http.request.write" => EffectClass::CommitIrreversible` match row), AND
  redundantly **fail-closed** by the `_ => EffectClass::CommitIrreversible` default
  (`sink_sensitivity.rs:83`) that already makes any UNKNOWN/new sink-id fail closed. The
  distinct CommitIrreversible id gets the full irreversible discipline: **I0 draft-deny**
  (`lib.rs:217`) + **I2 collect-then-Block** + **confirm-releasable** — matching the
  "distinct WRITE allowlist" framing in §2.1 and the `IrreversibleEffect` ontology (v1.8
  §2.1).
- **Confirm-releasability (resolved — was open in §1.7-style language).** CommitIrreversible
  ⇒ a **tainted-body WRITE Blocks under I2** and is **confirm-releasable** via the SAME
  single-shot human-confirm discipline as `github.pr` — the P33/P34 `prepare_*` precheck +
  terminal-audit-event-before-terminal-state gate (§1.7). A clean-body WRITE to a
  write-allowlisted host on a non-draft session proceeds; a tainted-body WRITE Blocks and can
  be released only by an explicit human confirm of the specific request (never a standing
  license).

### 2.1 A DISTINCT write host-allowlist (separate from the GET allowlist)

The shipped read/GET allowlist is `HOST_ALLOWLIST = ["api.github.com"]`
(`http_request.rs:101`), checked by `is_host_allowlisted` (`http_request.rs:119`). **A host
being GET-readable does NOT imply it is POST/PUT-writable** (`[rev: m1]`). Phase 43 MUST
introduce a **separate WRITE host-allowlist constant** (e.g. `WRITE_HOST_ALLOWLIST`) that the
WRITE path checks — NOT reuse `HOST_ALLOWLIST`. (Note: the existing `invoke_pinned_post`
currently gates on `HOST_ALLOWLIST` at `http_request.rs:513`; the generic `http.request`
WRITE sink MUST gate on the distinct write-allowlist instead, and `github.pr`'s fixed
`api.github.com` base is orthogonal broker-owned trusted config.) The write-allowlist is a
broker-local trusted-config **security property** (an operator-surfaced deployment constant),
never runtime-configurable from a plan node / `ValueNode` / audit DB — same status as
`HOST_ALLOWLIST`.

### 2.2 Body taint-governed + content-sensitive under I2; `url` routing-sensitive

The request **BODY is content-sensitive under I2** — a value assembled from untrusted
content (an `HttpRaw`/`ExecRaw`/`ExternalUntrusted`-tainted string) routed into the body
**deterministically Blocks** under the UNMODIFIED `submit_plan_node` collect-then-Block loop,
exactly like an `email.send` body or a `github.pr` `title`/`body` (v1.8 §4.4). This is the
marquee exfiltration defense for write-egress: without it a prompt-injected worker could
smuggle secrets out through a POST body. Taint is **genuinely propagated** (a real DAG edge),
never stapled at the sink. The **`url` is routing-sensitive** (it determines where the write
lands), I2-gated (tainted → Block).

### 2.3 Reuse the shipped SSRF resolve-and-pin verbatim

The WRITE path rides the SAME defense-in-depth as the GET (`http_request.rs`): `validate_url`
(`http_request.rs:135` — rejects `userinfo@`, non-`https`, explicit ports, IP-encoding
tricks) → write-allowlist gate BEFORE any resolve (fail-closed, §2.1) → `resolve_and_pin`
(`http_request.rs:431`) → `vet_resolved` → `ssrf_check` (`http_request.rs:175` — denies
loopback/RFC1918/link-local/metadata/CGNAT/ULA/IPv6-mapped/transition ranges) → pin to the
vetted IP with `redirect(Policy::none())` (`http_request.rs:335`). **No classifier is
re-implemented** — the WRITE path invokes the same functions. TLS anchors = the ring +
`webpki-roots` config (`ring_webpki_tls_config`, `http_request.rs:398`), `env_clear()`
hermetic (§3).

### 2.4 Broker-env-only credential custody + response scrub

Any write credential lives in **broker-local env ONLY** — never a `ValueNode`, plan-node
arg, audit-DAG literal, the confined worker, or the planner sidecar (`[rev: M1]`, same D-04
custody as `email_smtp.rs` and §1.4). The captured response is **scrubbed of credential
material (or not minted)** before it can reach the value store or audit chain — mirroring
§1.4 / v1.8 §2.5. If the WRITE response is minted as an inbound value at all, it is minted
via `mint_from_http` (untrusted-on-arrival, `HttpRaw` + `ExternalUntrusted`, session
demotion) — never stapled — so a response routed into a downstream sensitive sink Blocks on a
real DAG edge.

### 2.5 Differential acceptance (`[rev: M4]`)

Acceptance is **differential**, not "not blocked": the tainted-body-Blocks leg and the
clean-body-Allowed leg are **identical in host/url/method/policy** (taint is the sole
variable), and the clean leg is confirmed to have **actually delivered the body to the mock
endpoint on real Linux** (the mock records receipt). A block-everything I2 regression cannot
pass this — a passing run requires the clean body to arrive AND the tainted body to Block,
attributable to I2 specifically (LIVE-06).

### 2.6 The `method` arg is a schema-validated enum, never a free tainted literal (`[rev: MINOR-5]`)

The WRITE sink's `method` arg is **schema-validated against a FIXED enum** (e.g. `{POST,
PUT}`) at the Step-0 schema gate — it is **NEVER a free-form / tainted literal**. An
unrecognized, missing, or tainted-literal method → **Deny at the schema gate** (fail-closed,
§4). Crucially, the **WRITE-vs-GET allowlist + effect-class selection keys off the VALIDATED
method**: a request whose validated method is a write verb routes through the **distinct
`WRITE_HOST_ALLOWLIST`** (§2.1) and the **`http.request.write` `CommitIrreversible` id**
(§2.0); a GET routes through the shipped read path (`HOST_ALLOWLIST`, `Observe`). Selection is
driven by the **validated enum**, never by an attacker-supplied string — so a tainted/garbage
`method` can neither steer a write onto the GET-readable allowlist (escaping the write
gate/I0 class) nor vice-versa.

---

## §3. Crypto provider + supply-chain — ring-only, ZERO new crates (HYG-01)

**DECISION.** v1.9 adds **ZERO new crates**. `git.push` (§1) and `http.request` WRITE (§2)
reuse the already-shipped `reqwest =0.13.4` + `rustls 0.23` (ring provider) + `webpki-roots`
+ SSRF resolve-and-pin stack already in `brokerd` (`http_request.rs:398-405`
`ring_webpki_tls_config` uses `rustls::crypto::ring::default_provider()`;
`http_request.rs:368-390` `egress_root_store` uses `webpki-roots::TLS_SERVER_ROOTS`). Per the
research: `cargo tree -p brokerd -i openssl-sys` = not-found; ring-only, no aws-lc-rs/openssl
C. The only new code is auditable Rust protocol glue (pkt-line framing + the two HTTP
requests + `report-status` parse), well-specified by `gitprotocol-http` — no new dependency,
no external binary, no userns/netns.

**Gate 5 workspace-scoped absence re-run (HYG-01).** `scripts/check-invariants.sh` Gate 5
(`check-invariants.sh:211-233`) asserts, over the WHOLE workspace graph (NOT `-p brokerd` —
resolver-3 unifies features workspace-wide), that `cargo tree --workspace -i aws-lc-rs` and
`cargo tree --workspace -i openssl-sys` (via a reqwest path) are **absent**. This assertion
**RE-RUNS after the `git.push` transport dependency is chosen** (Phase 44), enumerating any
new transport deps — not just deps known at planning time. If a new dep IS added it MUST honor
the ring-only recipe (`rustls-no-provider` + an explicitly-supplied ring `CryptoProvider`),
or Gate 5 fails the build. This is the resolver-3 feature-unification lesson (v1.8 Phase-37
MAJOR: a sibling crate's `reqwest features=["rustls"]` silently pulled aws-lc-rs C into the
broker TCB). HYG-01 also broadens the Gate-4b never-default discipline
(`check-invariants.sh:180-189`) to a workspace-wide grep and adds a feature-OFF guard step in
`compose-verify.sh`.

## §4. Fail-Closed Defaults Table

Each row states the safe default when a precondition is absent/ambiguous. New v1.9 mechanisms
only; v1.8's table (its §8) carries forward for the shared GET/`github.pr`/SSRF rows.

| Sink arg / mechanism | Sensitivity | Default posture | Fail-closed behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `git.push` destination pin | routing | broker resolves ONCE, freezes the vetted IP across info/refs GET + receive-pack POST; pin in the app layer (`http_request.rs:337`), never seccomp | unresolvable / SSRF-range / mixed DNS answer → Deny; a re-resolve or redirect between requests → refused |
| `git.push` `remote` / `refspec` | routing (I2-gated) | from TRUSTED intent only, never repo `.git/config` | tainted → Block; not-from-trusted-intent → Deny; `--force`/deletion/`+`-force shape → hard Deny (unreachable even via confirm) |
| `git.push` credential custody | secret | broker-local env ONLY; `Authorization`/askpass to the transfer leg alone | ever appearing in a `ValueNode`/audit-literal/broker-log/worker → the design is violated; captured output not-minted-or-scrubbed |
| `git.push` captured output | untrusted | opaque event (`git_push_succeeded`/`_failed`, `effect_id` only) OR scrubbed before mint | any `https://…@…`/`Authorization:`/token substring surviving into value-store/audit → regression-test FAIL |
| `git.push` no-sound-mechanism | — | broker-performed transfer under review | if unsound under §9 trace → DEFER (disclosed, sign-off-gated); NEVER ship net-allowed child |
| `http.request` WRITE host | routing | **distinct** `WRITE_HOST_ALLOWLIST`, checked BEFORE any resolve | non-write-allowlisted host → Deny at the gate (a GET-readable host is NOT implicitly writable) |
| `http.request` WRITE `body` | content-sensitive (I2) | taint carrier, never re-minted clean | tainted → Block (collect-then-Block); unknown/missing → Deny at Step 0 schema gate |
| `http.request` WRITE `url` | routing-sensitive (I2) | resolve-and-pin; redirect-none | SSRF-range/redirect/`userinfo@`/non-https → Deny; tainted → Block |
| `http.request` WRITE `method` | structural (schema enum) | validated against a FIXED `{POST,PUT}` enum; the validated verb drives WRITE-vs-GET allowlist + effect-class selection | unrecognized/missing/tainted-literal method → Deny at the Step-0 schema gate; never a free tainted literal |
| `http.request.write` effect class | lifecycle (I0) | DISTINCT sink id classed `CommitIrreversible` (explicit row + `_ =>` default), NOT the GET id's `Observe` | a draft/untrusted-seeded session cannot Allow the POST (I0 deny fires only on `CommitIrreversible`, `lib.rs:217`); tainted body Blocks under I2, confirm-releasable |
| `http.request` WRITE credential + response | secret / untrusted | broker-local env only; response scrubbed or `mint_from_http`-tainted | credential in value-store/audit → violated; response stapled-clean → violated |
| session policy source (POLICY-03) | trust binding | bound by broker at session creation from a trusted path outside worker reach (F1) | policy path at-or-beneath workspace root, or unresolvable/absent → **refuse to run** (fail-closed, no session) |
| policy vs I2 (POLICY-02) | invariant | policy narrows which sinks/args are callable | policy PERMIT never disables I2 — a tainted sensitive arg on a permitted call still Blocks; policy can only add a Deny, never remove a Block |
| policy-deny outcome (POLICY-01) | structural | distinct machine-checkable policy-deny, separate from an I2 Block | sink/arg not permitted by policy → policy-Deny (distinct terminal tag), before/independent of I2 |

---

## §5. The policy↔I2 boundary — pre-I2 narrowing gate + POLICY-03 binding (POLICY-01/02/03)

This is the **#1 adversarial-trace risk** of the milestone (T-41-02): a design that lets
policy override or disable I2 would convert the trust surface into a bypass. This section
pins **exactly** what policy can and cannot do, and where policy comes from.

### 5.1 Policy is a PRE-I2 narrowing gate — it decides WHICH sinks/args are callable (POLICY-01)

**DECISION.** A minimal declarative **per-session policy** — a **hardcoded-schema struct/file
(NOT Cedar)** — specifies which sinks are callable + coarse arg constraints (allowlisted
hosts / paths / repos). It is a **pre-I2 narrowing gate**: it can only *remove* authority
(refuse a sink/arg that would otherwise be callable), never *add* it. A sink or arg not
permitted by the session's policy is refused with a **DISTINCT, machine-checkable policy-deny
outcome** — a terminal event/decision tag **separate from an I2 Block** (POLICY-01). The two
mechanisms are independently attributable: a policy-deny says "this call was never
permitted"; an I2 Block says "this permitted call carried an attacker-tainted value into a
sensitive arg." Phase 42 introduces a distinct `DenyReason::PolicyDeny` (or equivalent),
never conflated with the I2 Block variant.

### 5.2 Policy can NEVER disable or override I2 — I2 stays HARDCODED, unconditional (POLICY-02, LOCKED)

**DECISION (LOCKED INVARIANT).** Policy may only gate WHICH sinks/args are callable — it can
**NEVER disable or override I2**. The I2 decision stays **HARDCODED in the Rust TCB executor**
(`crates/executor`, the CON-i2-non-bypassable discipline — sensitivity is a security property
via `is_content_sensitive`/`is_routing_sensitive`/`expected_role` table rows in
`sink_sensitivity.rs`, never a swappable policy file). I2 **executes unconditionally on every
policy-PERMITTED call** and can **never be short-circuited by any policy outcome** (`[rev:
m3]`): policy is evaluated *before* I2 as a narrowing gate; a PERMIT hands the call to the
UNMODIFIED `submit_plan_node` collect-then-Block loop, where an attacker-tainted value in a
sensitive sink arg **still Blocks regardless of policy**. There is no policy value, however
permissive, that removes an I2 Block. This is proven later by a **live leg where a permissive
policy does NOT weaken the I2 taint Block** (LIVE-06 leg 3: the I2-Block legs run a sink+arg
the policy explicitly PERMITS, so policy is provably not what's blocking). This is the caprun
anti-requirement "Policy that can disable/override I2" (`.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` Out of
Scope).

### 5.3 POLICY-03 — the broker binds policy at session creation from a trusted source outside worker reach

**DECISION (`[rev: B1 + Matt #1` — both reviewers converged, BLOCKER-class; EXTRACTION
mandate added by `[rev: MAJOR-2]`).** The session policy is **bound by the broker at session
creation from a trusted source provably outside the confined worker's reach**, enforcing the
**SAME containment predicate** as MAC-key custody — but that predicate MUST be **EXTRACTED
into a single shared, unit-tested helper**, NOT "reused verbatim" / re-inlined. Today the F1
logic is **inline** in `load_or_create_key` (`cli/caprun/src/key.rs:60-110`): canonicalize
the workspace root (`std::fs::canonicalize(workspace_root)`, `key.rs:74`), canonicalize each
candidate via `canonicalize_existing_or_parent` (`key.rs:82,166`), and **refuse — hard `Err`,
nothing returned/written — if the canonical candidate `starts_with` the canonical workspace
root** (`key.rs:88-95`). There is **NO standalone containment fn**, AND `load_or_create_key`
is **`pub(crate)` in the `cli/caprun` binary crate**, while POLICY-03 binding runs
**broker-side (`crates/brokerd`, a TCB crate)** — so the check is **not even reachable**, let
alone callable verbatim, from the policy binder. Therefore:

- **EXTRACT the containment predicate into ONE shared helper** — e.g.
  `fn refuse_if_beneath_workspace(path: &Path, workspace_root: &Path) -> Result<()>` — placed
  in a crate reachable by **BOTH** call sites. Because `key.rs` lives in `cli/caprun`
  (`pub(crate)`) and the policy binder lives in `crates/brokerd`, the helper **lifts into a
  shared locus** — most likely `crates/runtime-core`, or a shared `brokerd`/`sandbox` util the
  CLI also depends on (Phase 42 picks the crate, but it MUST be one BOTH sites can call). BOTH
  MAC-key custody (`load_or_create_key`) AND the policy binding call the **identical** fn. A
  **regression test MUST assert both sites call the shared fn** (not two divergent copies that
  can drift).
- **Preserve the fail-closed-on-unresolvable semantics** exactly. `canonicalize_existing_or_parent`
  (`key.rs:166`): a **nonexistent** path canonicalizes its **parent** then rejoins the final
  component — a naive `std::fs::canonicalize()` would error/drift on a not-yet-existing path,
  so the helper MUST keep the parent-then-rejoin behavior. Preserve too the
  `canonicalize(workspace_root)` **requires-root-exists** behavior (`key.rs:74`): an
  **unresolvable/absent policy path is itself a refusal** (fail-closed, never fail-open) —
  the `with_context` bails at `key.rs:74`/`key.rs:82` mean a path that cannot be resolved
  refuses to run, exactly as key custody does.
- **The `starts_with` check is already component-wise correct.** `std::path::Path::starts_with`
  matches whole path components, so `/ws-foo` does **NOT** match `/ws` — there is **no
  sibling-prefix bug**. The **only** gap MAJOR-2 closes is the **factoring** (extract + share
  across the crate boundary so the broker binder can actually call it), not the predicate
  logic.
- The policy binding MUST run this SAME shared helper against the policy path: **refuse if the
  policy path resolves at-or-beneath the workspace root**, because the confined worker —
  caprun's PRIMARY adversary — could `RequestFd` any file beneath the workspace root via the
  SAME `WorkspaceRoot::read_within` reach the broker grants for legitimate reads
  (`key.rs:13-26` F1 rationale), then rewrite its own policy to widen its allowlist (the
  F1-precedent attack, `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` Out of Scope "Policy loaded from a
  session/worker-writable location").
- The bound policy is **immutable for the session's life** — a confined worker that
  writes/rewrites a policy file mid-session does **NOT** change the enforced allowlist
  (proven by a **negative live leg**).
- The policy's **identity/hash is recorded as a genuine audit-DAG event** at session creation
  (a real `append_event`, chained into the SHA-256 hash chain — not stapled), so the enforced
  policy is provable after the fact via the audit-DAG viewer (U1).

Note the `:memory:` carve-out precedent (`key.rs:64`, no F1 check for an in-memory DB) is
custody-specific and does **not** apply to policy binding — a session always binds a policy
from a trusted on-disk (or broker-in-memory-constructed trusted) source; there is no
worker-reachable policy path.

## §6. Threat Model — one § per pitfall → named mechanism

Mirrors v1.8 §6: each pitfall closed by a NAMED structural mechanism, cross-referenced to the
§ that pins it.

| # | Pitfall | Named mechanism | § |
|---|---------|-----------------|---|
| 1 | `git.push` credential leak (broker holds token + sees full HTTP exchange) | Token in broker-local env ONLY; `Authorization` set on the request, never persisted/minted; captured output opaque-or-scrubbed; regression test asserts no `https://…@…`/`Authorization:`/token substring in value-store/audit (carries v1.8 §2.5) | §1.4 |
| 2 | `git.push` destination-pin bypass (redirect / DNS-rebind across the two requests) | ONE frozen resolved IP reused across info/refs GET + receive-pack POST (no re-resolve, `http_request.rs:431`); POST 3xx refused (`redirect(Policy::none())`, `http_request.rs:335`) | §1.5 |
| 3 | `git.push` payload-vs-destination confirm TOCTOU (worker rewrites tree post-confirm) | Pack frozen/generated from the confirmed commit range **at-or-after confirm**; provenance summary shown at confirm describes the SAME bytes POSTed; broker (not worker) drives pack gen (carries v1.8 §2.7) | §1.6 |
| 4 | `send-pack` self-egress (git subprocess opens its own socket) | seccomp `socket(AF_INET/AF_INET6) → EPERM` fail-closed backstop (`seccomp.rs:163-188`); transport delegates all network to the broker mover | §1.8 |
| 5 | net-deny widening (a relaxation to pin a destination) | NO seccomp relaxation — provably cannot pin a destination behind a `connect()` pointer; child stays fully net-denied (`exec_child_filter`, `seccomp.rs:147`); pin is broker application-layer only (BLOCKER-1, carries v1.8 §2.1) | §1.2 |
| 6 | `http.request` WRITE tainted-body exfil | body is I2 content-sensitive → tainted Blocks on a real DAG edge (collect-then-Block), like an email/PR body; genuinely propagated, never stapled | §2.2 |
| 7 | `http.request` WRITE credential leak in captured response | credential broker-local env ONLY; response scrubbed or `mint_from_http`-tainted (never stapled-clean) before value-store/audit (`[rev: M1]`) | §2.4 |
| 8 | `http.request` WRITE to a GET-only host | DISTINCT `WRITE_HOST_ALLOWLIST`, checked before any resolve — GET-readable ≠ POST/PUT-writable (`[rev: m1]`) | §2.1 |
| 9 | policy-as-I2-override (the LOCKED anti-requirement, #1 trace risk) | I2 HARDCODED in the Rust TCB executor, unconditional on every policy-PERMITTED call; policy is a pre-I2 narrowing gate that can only add a Deny, never remove a Block (POLICY-02) | §5.2 |
| 10 | policy from a worker-writable location (worker widens its own allowlist — F1-precedent attack) | POLICY-03 binds policy from a trusted source; F1 containment reused verbatim from `key.rs` — refuse any policy path at-or-beneath the workspace root; immutable; hash audit-DAG-recorded | §5.3 |
| 11 | tainted / traversal policy path (unresolvable or crafted path binds an attacker policy) | F1 fail-closed: an unresolvable/absent path is a refusal (`key.rs:73,166`); canonicalize-then-`starts_with` refusal (`key.rs:88-95`) rejects at-or-beneath-workspace; no session runs on a refused policy | §5.3 |
| 12 | policy-deny indistinguishable from an I2 Block (undermines LIVE-06 attributability) | DISTINCT machine-checkable `DenyReason::PolicyDeny` terminal tag, separate from the I2 Block; the two emit distinct terminal-event tags asserted separately (POLICY-01, LIVE-06 leg 3) | §5.1 |

---

## §7. Invariant Preservation

Each item checked with a one-line justification (mirrors v1.8 §7):

- [x] **I0 unaffected — and now CITED, not merely asserted, for the WRITE POST** — no new
  session-creation path weakens seeding; a session seeded from external/untrusted content
  still starts draft-only and cannot auto-authorize a `CommitIrreversible` push or a WRITE
  POST. **The WRITE POST is I0-gated precisely because `http.request.write` is a DISTINCT
  sink id classed `EffectClass::CommitIrreversible`** (§2.0; explicit match row + the `_ =>`
  default, `sink_sensitivity.rs:83`): the I0/Draft lifecycle deny fires only on
  `CommitIrreversible` (`lib.rs:217`), so a draft/untrusted-seeded session cannot Allow the
  POST. Were WRITE folded into the shipped `Observe`-classed `http.request` id, it would
  **fall through** the I0 gate (`lib.rs:206-239` never fires for `Observe`) — the escape §2.0
  closes. Policy binding at session creation (§5.3) *narrows* authority; it never seeds trust.
- [x] **I1 preserved AND extended** — a WRITE response minted as an inbound value goes through
  `mint_from_http` (untrusted-on-arrival, session demotion), exactly the I1 direction (§2.4);
  no sink reads raw untrusted bytes into the worker. `git.push`'s network leg is broker-side;
  the worker gains no net.
- [x] **I2 NOT weakened or bypassed** — `git.push` (`remote`/`refspec`) and `http.request`
  WRITE (`url`/`body`) are `PlanNode{sink,args}` from spawn and route through the UNMODIFIED
  `submit_plan_node` collect-then-Block loop. Policy is a **pre-I2 narrowing gate only** (§5.2)
  — it can add a Deny but never remove a Block; I2 stays HARDCODED in the executor and runs
  unconditionally on every permitted call. New executor changes are table rows
  (`KNOWN_SINKS`, `sink_effect_class`, sensitivity/`expected_role`) + a distinct policy-deny
  outcome — no new `ExecutorDecision` that short-circuits I2.
- [x] **No new raw effect-request-to-sink path** — every effect stays a plan node
  (`submit_plan_node(session_id, PlanNode{sink, args: Vec<ValueNode>})`). This doc introduces
  no `EffectRequest`-shaped path anywhere, so `check-invariants.sh` Gate 1
  (`check-invariants.sh:29-36`) stays green with zero new hits. Policy narrows the plan-node
  path; it does not add a bypass around it.
- [x] **Sink sensitivity + I2 stay HARDCODED in the executor** — the new sinks add
  sensitivity/effect-class/role TABLE ROWS ONLY; policy is a **separate** narrowing layer that
  never touches the sensitivity determination. Sensitivity is a security property, not a
  config knob (CON-i2-non-bypassable).
- [x] **Genuine, non-stapled taint** — WRITE-response taint (if minted) is minted ONLY inside
  `mint_from_http` at a real `http_response_received` Event (`provenance_chain[0]` == that
  Event id); the executor never mints, never sets taint (it only `value_store.resolve()`s).
  The policy hash is a genuine `append_event`, not stapled.

---

## §8. New-Mechanism Symbol Summary + mandated gate extensions

New symbols the v1.9 implementation phases introduce (each appears ONLY in this DESIGN-doc
prose this phase, NEVER under `crates/` or `cli/` yet):

| Symbol | Phase | Locus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `DenyReason::PolicyDeny` (distinct from the I2 Block) | 42 | `crates/executor` / `crates/runtime-core` decision type |
| session-policy struct/schema + `policy_bound` audit-DAG event (hash recorded) | 42 | `crates/brokerd` (bind at session creation) + `crates/runtime-core` (policy type) |
| shared `refuse_if_beneath_workspace` containment helper (**EXTRACTED** from `key.rs`'s inline F1 check; called by BOTH MAC-key custody + policy binding; regression-tested that both sites call it) (`[rev: MAJOR-2]`) | 42 | shared crate (e.g. `crates/runtime-core` / shared util) + callers in `crates/brokerd` (policy bind) & `cli/caprun` (key custody + run entrypoint) |
| `WRITE_HOST_ALLOWLIST` (distinct from `HOST_ALLOWLIST`) | 43 | `crates/brokerd/src/sinks/http_request.rs` |
| `http.request.write` = **DISTINCT sink id**, `sink_effect_class` ⇒ `CommitIrreversible` (explicit match row + `_ =>` fail-closed default `sink_sensitivity.rs:83`) — NOT the GET id's `Observe` (`[rev: MAJOR-1]`) | 43 | `crates/executor/src/sink_sensitivity.rs` |
| `http.request` WRITE sink rows (`KNOWN_SINKS`, `body` content-sensitive, `url` routing, `method` schema-validated `{POST,PUT}` enum) | 43 | `crates/executor/src/{sink_schema,sink_sensitivity}.rs` |
| `git.push` smart-HTTP transfer glue (pkt-line + info/refs GET + receive-pack POST + report-status parse) | 44 | `crates/brokerd/src/sinks/*` (Rust glue; ZERO new crates) |
| `prepare_git_push` precheck + `git_push_succeeded`/`_failed` opaque events + entry-guard allow-list extension | 44 | `crates/brokerd/src/sinks/*` + `confirmation.rs` (Step 4.75 guard `:825-846`, Step 4.8 precheck) |
| `git.push` = `CommitIrreversible`, new sensitivity/role rows | 44 | `crates/executor/src/{sink_schema,sink_sensitivity}.rs` |

**Mandated gate extensions.** (a) **Gate 5 re-run** (§3) — `check-invariants.sh:211-233`
re-runs after the `git.push` transport dep is chosen (Phase 44), enumerating any new transport
deps (ring-only, aws-lc-rs/openssl-sys absent workspace-wide). (b) **Gate 4b workspace-wide**
(HYG-01) — broaden `check-invariants.sh:180-189` to a workspace-wide grep + a feature-OFF
guard in `compose-verify.sh`. (c) If any new `mint_from_*` call site is introduced, it MUST be
added to Gate 3's restricted-token list (`check-invariants.sh:134-138`) in the same commit —
`mint_from_http(` is already present (`check-invariants.sh:137`), so a WRITE response reusing
it needs no new Gate-3 token.

---

## §9. Adversarial-Trace Gate (DESIGN-18) — ORCHESTRATOR-owned, re-runs on a mid-build pivot

**This doc is authored by a `gsd-executor`, which does NOT run or self-perform the
adversarial code-trace.** gsd-executors have **no Agent tool**; the fresh, non-self
adversarial review is the **ORCHESTRATOR's** job, run AFTER this plan completes.

**DECISION (DESIGN-18).** Before ANY `crates/{executor,brokerd,sandbox,runtime-core}` or
`cli/` TCB code for a v1.9 surface is written, this doc MUST clear a **fresh, NON-SELF,
ORCHESTRATOR-OWNED adversarial code-trace** — a different model, traced against real code
(not a prose-read), the standing `fresh-context-adversarial-review` guardrail that has caught
9+ real BLOCKER/MAJOR defects through v1.8 (incl. the v1.8 BLOCKER-1 that deferred `git.push`
in the first place). Every BLOCKER/MAJOR must be resolved and folded back into this doc before
the gate clears. The orchestrator records the outcome — verdict, findings, resolutions, and a
final GATE CLEARED marker — in **`planning-docs/DESIGN-GATE-RECORD-v1.9.md`** (the shape of
`DESIGN-GATE-RECORD-v1.8.md`).

**Re-run trigger (`[rev: n2]`).** The trace **RE-RUNS** if the `git.push` **trust-posture or
transport-dependency choice changes mid-implementation** — this doc itself names `git.push`
"the riskiest surface in the project," so a mid-build transport pivot (e.g. switching the
network mover, adding a new transport dep, or altering where the destination pin lives) MUST
NOT bypass the one gate meant to catch it. A pivot re-runs the trace and updates
`DESIGN-GATE-RECORD-v1.9.md` before any pivoted code lands. If the pivot cannot clear the
trace, the §1.9 safety-valve applies (disclosed, sign-off-gated `git.push` deferral).

The executor's sole responsibility is to make this doc **review-ready**: decisions pinned,
every load-bearing claim cited to a re-verified `file:line`. The executor does not write
`DESIGN-GATE-RECORD-v1.9.md` and does not self-attest the gate.

---

## §10. Acceptance Predicate — Done When

Phase 41's gate is cleared when ALL are true:

1. This doc pins, as **DECISIONS** (not options): (a) `git.push` = broker-performed
   smart-HTTP destination-pinned egress with the child fully net-denied and the pin in the
   broker application layer (never seccomp), closing all three research attack points (§1) —
   incl. the §1.4 credential/remote-URL absence assertion **extended to broker LOG output**
   (LIVE-06 leg 5) and the §1.5 single-frozen-IP client that does NOT re-resolve for the POST;
   (b) `http.request` WRITE = a **DISTINCT sink id (`http.request.write`) classed
   `CommitIrreversible`** (§2.0) + a DISTINCT write-allowlist + taint-governed
   content-sensitive body under I2 + a schema-validated `method` enum + differential
   acceptance (§2); (c) the policy↔I2 boundary incl. POLICY-03 F1-containment binding via a
   **shared EXTRACTED helper** (§5). **(DESIGN-17.)**
2. This doc carries forward v1.8 **§2 / §2.5 / §2.7 / §9** by reference (§0, §1.4, §1.6,
   §1.7), pins **ring-only / ZERO new crates + the Gate-5 workspace-scoped re-run** (§3),
   gives a **fail-closed defaults table** (§4) and a **§-per-pitfall threat model** (§6),
   shows **invariant preservation** (§7, I0/I1/I2 unweakened, no raw `EffectRequest` path),
   and summarizes the **new symbols + mandated gate extensions** (§8).
3. This doc formalizes the **`git.push` safety-valve** (§1.9): if no fully-unprivileged
   destination-pinning mechanism proves sound under the §9 trace, `git.push` DEFERS
   (disclosed, sign-off-gated, auto-descopes from LIVE-05/06) and the other three tracks
   proceed — **never a silent drop, never a net-allowed child**.
4. This doc declares the fresh adversarial code-trace **ORCHESTRATOR-owned (NOT a
   gsd-executor)** and **re-running on a mid-build `git.push` trust-posture / transport-dep
   pivot** (§9, DESIGN-18).
5. `scripts/check-invariants.sh` exits 0 against this doc's presence (no architectural-
   invariant regression from its prose), and **no `crates/{executor,brokerd,sandbox,
   runtime-core}` / `cli/` code exists yet** — `git status --porcelain -- crates cli` is
   empty. **No TCB code is written until DESIGN-18 clears (§9).**

## Round-1 Amendments (DESIGN-18 adversarial trace)

A fresh, non-self, orchestrator-owned adversarial code-trace (DESIGN-18) surfaced 2 MAJOR +
3 MINOR findings, each VERIFIED against live code. All 5 are folded below; every fix is a
DESIGN decision (prose/pin), no TCB code.

- **MAJOR-1 (BLOCKER-level) — `http.request` WRITE effect class pinned so it can't escape the
  I0 gate.** `sink_effect_class` (`sink_sensitivity.rs:40-83`) keys on sink-id only, and
  `"http.request" => Observe` (`:64`) means the I0/Draft deny (`lib.rs:206-239`, fires only on
  `CommitIrreversible` at `:217`) would NOT fire for a WRITE folded into the GET id → Allowed
  in a draft session. Fix: WRITE is a **DISTINCT sink id `http.request.write`** classed
  **`CommitIrreversible`** (explicit row + `_ =>` fail-closed default `:83`). Added §2.0
  (new); updated §0(2), the §7 I0 checkbox (now cites the class), §8 (new effect-class row),
  and §4 (new effect-class row). Confirm-releasability resolved: tainted body Blocks under I2,
  confirm-releasable via the P33/P34 precheck like `github.pr`.
- **MAJOR-2 — POLICY-03 F1 containment EXTRACTED into a shared tested helper, not "reused
  verbatim."** The F1 logic is inline in `load_or_create_key` (`key.rs:60-110`) and
  `pub(crate)` in `cli/caprun`, so it is unreachable from the broker-side (`brokerd`) policy
  binder. Fix: §5.3 (and §0) now mandate **extracting** `refuse_if_beneath_workspace(path,
  workspace_root)` into a crate BOTH sites can call (e.g. `runtime-core`), preserving
  `canonicalize_existing_or_parent`'s parent-then-rejoin fail-closed semantics and the
  requires-root-exists behavior, with a regression test that BOTH sites call the shared fn.
  Noted the `starts_with` check is already component-wise correct (no sibling-prefix bug — the
  only gap is factoring). Updated §8 symbol row.
- **MINOR-3 — `invoke_pinned_post` re-resolves DNS; §1.4/§1.5 reconciled.**
  `invoke_pinned_post` (`http_request.rs:506`) calls `resolve_and_pin` internally (`:531` →
  fresh resolve `:435-444`), reopening the DNS-rebind window. Fix: §1.5 now states
  `invoke_pinned_post` CANNOT be reused as-is; Phase 44 builds a **single `reqwest::Client`
  once** via `build_pinned_client` (`:333`) from one vetted `SocketAddr` and issues BOTH the
  info/refs GET and the receive-pack POST through it. §1.4 credential pointer reconciled to the
  same single-client POST.
- **MINOR-4 — credential/URL-absence assertion extended to broker LOGS.** Research
  attack-point (i) names broker error-log lines (proxy-auth `407`, URL echoes) as a leak
  vector; `do_pinned_post`'s error path (`http_request.rs:542`) can embed URL/redirect
  material into a log line. Fix: §1.4's credential-absence assertion (and §10 acceptance, →
  LIVE-06 leg 5) now also asserts **no credential/remote-URL material reaches broker LOG
  output** on the git-push HTTP legs (or the broker never logs body/URL on those legs).
- **MINOR-5 — stateless-rpc confidence + method-arg validation.** Research rates
  `send-pack --stateless-rpc` MEDIUM confidence. Fix: §1.1 now makes **broker-generates-the-
  receive-pack-body-directly** the PRIMARY realization (avoids the send-pack URL-arg /
  invocation surface), keeping stateless-rpc as the documented alternative + the §1.8 seccomp
  backstop + §1.9 safety-valve. §2.6 (new) pins `method` as a **schema-validated enum**
  (`{POST,PUT}`, never a free tainted literal), with WRITE-vs-GET allowlist/class selection
  keyed off the VALIDATED method; §4 gains a `method` row.
