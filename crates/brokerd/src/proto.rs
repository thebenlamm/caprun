/// SECURITY CONTRACT (ASM-03 / I2):
/// - Raw source bytes NEVER appear here — only the extracted typed value crosses
///   the IPC boundary. The surrounding hostile sentence is discarded inside the

/// - Unknown `kind` values fail closed: the exhaustive enum (no wildcard / other-arm)
///   causes serde to return a deserialize error for any unrecognized tag, so the
///   broker never silently coerces an unknown claim kind to a known one.
///
/// Phase 5 shipped `EmailAddress`; Phase 7 (07-04b) adds `RelativePath` so a
/// workspace-derived path can cross the IPC boundary and be minted
/// `[ExternalUntrusted, PathRaw]` by the broker (never `LocalWorkspace`).
