<summary>✅ v1.0 MVP — AgentOS v0 (Phases 1-4) — SHIPPED 2026-06-30</summary>

Full detail archived in [`milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md).

- [x] **Phase 1: Substrate Foundation** (2/2 plans) — Cargo workspace, domain core, locked plan-node broker API — completed 2026-06-29
- [x] **Phase 2: Security Design Gate** (3/3 plans) — taint-model + plan-executor DESIGN docs that hard-gate all executor code — completed 2026-06-29
- [x] **Phase 3: Confinement & Mediation Substrate** (5/5 plans) — kernel confinement, broker reference monitor, fd-pass fs adapter, no-LLM substrate demo (Linux-verified 29/29) — completed 2026-06-29
- [x] **Phase 4: Value-Injection Security Demo (v0 DONE)** (5/5 plans) — §9 acceptance test passes with a genuine, audited taint chain — completed 2026-06-30

**v0 DONE gate cleared:** the §9 value-injection test blocks a tainted address at a mediated sink with literal-value confirmation; `mint_from_read` is the sole broker taint-mint site; stapled taint fails the test. `cargo test --workspace` = 51 green.
